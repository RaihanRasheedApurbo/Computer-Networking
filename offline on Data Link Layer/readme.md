This offline comes next after the reliable transport protocol (rtp) offline that was done considering transport layer. Now we are going to use same simulation framework to simulate a basic data link layer protocol(dll). Here we implement 1bit sliding window protocol with CRC (Cyclic redundancy check). 

Here we are started our code from the given simulator code just like rtp offline. As I needed to run debugger quite a lot that's why I did my code on clion so couldn't commit much as this repo was on vscode structure... sorry for that....
