This offline comes next after the reliable transport protocol (rtp) offline that was done considering transport layer. Now we are going to use same simulation framework to simulate a basic data link layer protocol(dll). Here we implement 1bit sliding window protocol with CRC (Cyclic redundancy check). We are going to edit the code that was produced during the completion of rtp offline and try to implement and simulate this dll protocol.
