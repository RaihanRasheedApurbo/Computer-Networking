This repository contains all implemenations related to various networking layer and simulation. This projects were part of the course Computer Networking that I took in my 3rd year 2nd term in BUET.
Some of the topics that were implemented here are:
1. Offline on Data Link Layer: Sliding window protocol, Piggybacked acknowledgement, Timer based retransmission, Error control using CRC
2. Offline on Network Simulator 2(NS2): Wireless 802.15.4 (Wireless PAN), AODV (AdHoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol), TCP Tahoe, Telnet
3. Reliable Transport Protocl v3
4. Distance vector routing algorithm, Split horizon, Split horizon with poison reverse
