This is a project on based on Network Simulator 2 (NS2). 
The project specification and report can be found on a doc file on this folder. 
wirelessCopy.tcl contains the ns2 simulation code. 
run.sh is a bash file that helps to generate all the necessary file to complete the simulation. test.sh does the same thing.
trace files are parsed using testpy.py file
and graphs were generated using graphGenerator.py which was called after testpy.py did its job.
run.sh should be understood first to understand how this whole coding files work together.
