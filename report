dvr with split-horizon and forced update
router off - 3 10 14 15
A client having gateway at router 4 sending 20 clients randomly
total packet sent: 100
Total packet drop: 36
Average hop: 1.515625

observation: As 4 of 15 router is off here that is around 26.67% so we can safely assume that 
around 30% packets were directed towards those gateway router. so only 6% packets were
affected for not having updated routing table. So it proves dvr with split-horizon and forced
update reacts with network change in a good manner.


simple dvr
router off - 3 8 10 11
A client having gateway at router 13 sending 23 clients randomly
total packet sent: 100
Total packet drop: 66
Average hop: 1.0588235294117647

observation: In this experiment we can see 4 routers are off like before. so dropping 30% packet
would be close to ideal. But in this case though it had 23 clients it droped 66% packet which is
way far from the advanced DVR algorithm that we used. Moreover while doing this experiment multiple 
times DVR function was invoked by routers to update their table which wasn't the case for DVR 
with split horizon forced update. So not only simpleDVR funciton is worse from the packet drop 
perspective by a big margin but also it calls dvr routine more often than it counter parts which
can introduce significant latency into the network.
